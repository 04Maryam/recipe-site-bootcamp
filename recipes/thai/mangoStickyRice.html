          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <h5>For the Sticky Rice:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice (also called sticky rice or sweet rice)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups coconut milk (full-fat for creaminess)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For the Mango:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>2 ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For Garnishing:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds or mung beans (optional)</li>
            <li>A few mint leaves (optional)</li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Prep time:</b> 10 minutes</li>
              <li><b>Cook time:</b> 20-25 minutes</li>
              <li><b>Total time:</b> ~30-35 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Sticky Rice:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Rinse the glutinous rice in cold water until the water runs clear (this helps remove excess starch).</li>
                <li>Soak the rice in water for 4-6 hours (or overnight if possible) to ensure it cooks properly.</li>
                <li>After soaking, drain the rice.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook the Sticky Rice:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Using a bamboo steamer or a regular steamer, place the soaked rice in a cheesecloth or cheesecloth-lined colander. Steam over boiling water for 20-25 minutes, until the rice becomes tender and translucent.</li>
                <li>If you don't have a steamer, you can use a rice cooker with a steaming tray or a pot fitted with a lid.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Coconut Sauce:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>While the rice is steaming, combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously until the sugar and salt dissolve completely. Do not bring it to a boil; just heat it until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Remove from heat once the sugar is dissolved.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mix the Rice with Coconut Sauce:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Once the sticky rice is done steaming, transfer it to a mixing bowl. Pour the coconut milk mixture over the rice and gently stir to combine. Let the rice absorb the coconut milk and become creamy. Set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Mango:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Peel the mangoes and slice them into thin, even strips. Discard the pit.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Assemble the Dish:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>To serve, place a portion of the sticky rice onto a plate. Arrange the mango slices alongside the rice, or on top of it.</li>
                <li>Optional: Garnish with sesame seeds or mung beans for a slight crunch, and a mint leaf for added freshness.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
