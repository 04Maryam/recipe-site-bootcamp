          <ul>
            <li>1 jar (12 oz) grape leaves in brine (about 30-35 leaves)</li>
            <li>Water (for blanching the grape leaves)</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For the Cooking Liquid:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Prep time:</b> 30-40 minutes</li>
              <li><b>Cook time:</b> 40-50 minutes</li>
              <li><b>Total time:</b> ~1.5 hours</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Grape Leaves:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>If using jarred grape leaves, rinse them well under cold water to remove the brine and excess salt.</li>
                <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil, and briefly blanch the grape leaves (about 2-3 minutes), then drain and set aside to cool. If the grape leaves are too large, you can trim the thicker stems off.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Filling:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until softened and translucent (about 5 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add the ground meat (if using) and cook until browned. If you're making a vegetarian version, skip this step.</li>
                <li>Stir in the rice and cook for 2-3 minutes to toast it lightly.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato paste, pine nuts, currants (if using), mint, oregano, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Pour in the broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes, until the rice is slightly tender but not fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, stir in the chopped parsley, dill (if using), and lemon juice. Let the filling cool slightly.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Stuff the Grape Leaves:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Lay one grape leaf flat on a clean surface, vein side up.</li>
                <li>Place a spoonful of the filling (about 1-2 tablespoons) near the base of the leaf.</li>
                <li>Fold in the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it up tightly, folding from the base upwards like a burrito. Be gentle, but firm, to ensure it doesn’t unravel.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process with the remaining leaves and filling.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook the Dolma:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, arrange the stuffed grape leaves in layers, starting with the seam side down.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, broth, and salt, and pour this over the dolma.</li>
                <li>Place a heavy plate or lid on top of the dolma to keep them submerged in the liquid while cooking.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for 40-50 minutes, until the grape leaves are tender and the rice is fully cooked. You may need to add more water or broth if the liquid evaporates before the dolma is done.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow the dolma to rest for 10 minutes before serving, so the flavors can meld.</li>
                <li>Serve warm or at room temperature with a drizzle of olive oil and a side of yogurt or a squeeze of fresh lemon.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Dolma</b> is a flavorful and comforting dish, with tender grape leaves wrapped around a spiced rice filling, often accompanied by ground meat, pine nuts, and currants. Whether served as an appetizer, side dish, or main course, these stuffed grape leaves are a beloved part of Turkish cuisine. They are often paired with a refreshing yogurt dip and fresh lemon wedges for an added burst of flavor! Enjoy!</p>
