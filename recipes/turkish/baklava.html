          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <lh5>For the Baklava:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) phyllo dough (about 20 sheets)</li>
            <li>2 cups mixed nuts (typically pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts), finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For the Syrup:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick (optional)</li>
            <li>1-2 strips of lemon peel (optional)</li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prep time:</b> 30 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Cook time:</b> 45-50 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Total time:</b> ~1.5 hours</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Syrup:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, honey, cinnamon stick, and lemon peel (if using).</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, until the syrup thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let the syrup cool while you prepare the baklava.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Baklava:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
                <li>Brush the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with some of the melted butter.</li>
                <li>Place the first sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush it lightly with more melted butter.</li>
                <li>Continue layering and buttering phyllo sheets, one at a time, until you have about 8-10 sheets layered at the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>After the base layer is ready, spread a thin layer of the chopped nuts evenly over the phyllo dough. You can also add a pinch of ground cinnamon to the nuts if you like.</li>
                <li>Continue layering 2-3 sheets of phyllo dough, followed by another layer of nuts. Repeat this process until all the nuts are used up, and finish with about 8-10 more layers of phyllo dough on top.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cut the Baklava:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Before baking, use a sharp knife to cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. This makes it easier to serve after baking.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Bake the Baklava:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Bake the baklava in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the phyllo dough is golden and crispy.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on it toward the end to ensure it doesn't burn, as oven temperatures may vary.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Pour the Syrup:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Once the baklava is baked, remove it from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.</li>
                <li>Be sure to cover the entire surface with syrup. The baklava will soak up the syrup as it cools.</li>
                <li>Let the baklava sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the syrup to soak through and the layers to become beautifully sticky.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Once the baklava has fully absorbed the syrup, it is ready to be served.</li>
                <li>Garnish with extra chopped pistachios on top (optional).</li>
                <li>Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p><b>Baklava</b> is a rich, sweet pastry made from layers of buttery phyllo dough, chopped nuts, and a syrup made of sugar, honey, and lemon.
