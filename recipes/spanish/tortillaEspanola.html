          <p>Spanish omelette made with potatoes and onions.</p>
          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 medium potatoes (Yukon Gold or similar), peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prep time:</b> 10 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Cook time:</b> 30-40 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Total time:</b> ~40-50 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Potatoes and Onion:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Peel and slice the potatoes into thin rounds (about 1/8 inch thick).</li>
                <li>Slice the onion thinly as well.</li>
                <li>In a large non-stick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook the Potatoes and Onion:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Add the sliced potatoes and onions to the skillet, seasoning them with a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Cook gently over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The goal is to soften, not brown, the potatoes and onions. This will take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the potatoes are tender and cooked through, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the pan and drain excess oil on a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve a little oil in the pan for the next step.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Beat the Eggs:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, crack the eggs and beat them well with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked potatoes and onions to the eggs and gently mix, ensuring the potatoes are well coated. Let this mixture sit for a few minutes.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Cook the Tortilla:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Heat a smaller non-stick skillet (around 8-10 inches) over medium-low heat and add a bit of the reserved olive oil.</li>
                <li>Pour the potato-egg mixture into the pan, spreading it out evenly.</li>
                <li>Cook slowly on low heat for about 8-10 minutes, occasionally shaking the pan to prevent sticking. The edges will begin to set while the center remains slightly runny.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Flip the Tortilla:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Once the edges are set and the bottom is golden brown, it's time to flip the tortilla.</li>
                <li>Place a large plate over the skillet and carefully invert the pan to flip the tortilla. Then, slide the tortilla back into the pan to cook the other side.</li>
                <li>Cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the tortilla is fully set and golden brown on both sides.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Once done, remove the tortilla from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
