          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <h5>For the Churros:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For the Sugar Coating:</h5>
          <ul>
              <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>For the Hot Chocolate:</h5>
          <ul>
              <li>2 cups whole milk (or a mix of milk and cream for a richer taste)</li>
              <li>4 ounces dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher, finely chopped)</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons sugar (optional, to sweeten)</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, for a thicker consistency)</li>
          </ul>


          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prep time:</b> 20 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Cook time:</b> 10-15 minutes (for frying churros)</li>
            <li><b>Total time:</b> ~30-35 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>For the Churros:</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Make the Churro Dough:</b> In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water, butter, sugar, and salt to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally. Once the butter has melted and the water is boiling, remove from heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and forms a smooth ball. Let the dough cool slightly (about 5 minutes).</li>
                <li><b>Beat the Eggs:</b> Beat the eggs into the dough one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract if using. The dough should be smooth, thick, and slightly sticky.</li>
                <li><b>Heat the Oil:</b> Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pan or Dutch oven to 350°F (175°C). If you don't have a thermometer, you can test the oil by dropping a small piece of dough into the pan – if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
                <li><b>Shape the Churros:</b> Spoon the churro dough into a piping bag fitted with a large star-shaped tip (or use a Ziploc bag with the corner cut off). Carefully pipe the dough into the hot oil, making 4-6 inch long churros, and fry in batches. Don't overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li><b>Coat the Churros in Cinnamon Sugar:</b> Mix the sugar and cinnamon together in a shallow dish. While the churros are still hot, roll them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat evenly.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>For the Hot Chocolate:</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Prepare the Hot Chocolate:</b> In a small saucepan, heat the milk (and cream, if using) over medium heat until warm but not boiling. Add the chopped dark chocolate and stir continuously until melted and smooth. If you prefer a thicker hot chocolate, dissolve 1 teaspoon of cornstarch in a tablespoon of milk and stir it into the mixture. Continue to cook until it thickens to your liking. Add sugar to taste, depending on how sweet you want your chocolate. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Serve the churros warm, alongside a small cup of the hot chocolate for dipping. For a special touch, you can sprinkle extra cinnamon sugar on top of the churros before serving.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Churros con Chocolate is a perfect Spanish dessert or treat to enjoy with family and friends. The crispy, cinnamon-sugar-coated churros paired with smooth, velvety hot chocolate will satisfy any sweet tooth!</p>
