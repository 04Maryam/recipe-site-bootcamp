          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <h5>For the Churros:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>1 cup water</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or melted butter)</li>
              <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>2 large eggs</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
              <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>For the Cinnamon Sugar Coating:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Preparation Time</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prep time:</b> 15 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Cook time:</b> 10 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Total time:</b> ~25 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, salt, and vegetable oil to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add 1 cup of flour. Stir continuously until the mixture forms a dough and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let the dough cool for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the dough is slightly cooler but still warm, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. The dough should be smooth and slightly sticky.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Heat the Oil:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>In a deep pot or frying pan, heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can test the temperature by dropping a small piece of dough into the oil – it should bubble up and fry quickly.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Shape the Churros:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Transfer the churro dough into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip (or use a large Ziploc bag with the tip of one corner cut off).</li>
                <li>Carefully pipe the dough into the hot oil, forming strips of about 4-6 inches long. Fry in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Fry the Churros:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Fry the churros for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and crispy. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to turn them and remove them from the oil.</li>
                <li>Place the cooked churros on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Coat the Churros:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>While the churros are still warm, combine the sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll the churros in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Serve the churros warm, with a side of chocolate sauce or dulce de leche for dipping, if desired.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Churros</b> are a classic Mexican treat that's crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and perfectly sweetened with cinnamon sugar. They're easy to make at home and are perfect for any occasion, whether as a dessert, snack, or part of a festive meal!</p>
